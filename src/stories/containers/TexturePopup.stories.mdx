# Texture Popup
## This Popup appears on screen if the (Plus) button is clicked next to a property. See in the prototype below.

This popup contains the following components: 
-   A. Preview: The very top component that displays either the image, gradient editor or solid color picker
-   B. Texture Type Dropdown: A dropdown where the user can choose between different texture types (Solid, Texture, Gradient)
-   C. Tabs: These are sub options of the given Texture Type. It can happen that a Solid has completely different Tabs as Image.
-   D. Options: The options that belong to a specific Texture Types' Tab. - Those are components by themselves as well.

<Preview>
    <Story name="default">
        <div style={{height: "500px"}}>
        <TexturePropertyProvider >
            <TexturePopup />
        </TexturePropertyProvider >
        </div>    
    </Story>
</Preview>

# A & B -> Preview and Texture Type Drop-down
## The Preview (A) is dependent on the Texture Type (B). So use the dropdown to switch between states
The Preview changes states depending on the Texture Type. 
If set to Texture, it displayes the image with real time preview about it's tranformations or adjustments. E.g. if you apply red overlay on a texture it is reflected in the Preview

- I.    Texture Mode: An image Texture is shown with adjustments applied
- II.   Gradient Mode: A real-time gradient editor. 
-      II a. where always the bigger point is Selected. 
      II b. The Selected Points Color can be readjusted via the slider controls, or the Color Input (RGB, HEX, HSB)
      II c. A new Point can be added anywhere between any two points. 
      II d. These control points are not visible only if the Mouse is Hovering over the Entire Popup
      II e. The Color of the Selected point can be set by the Color Picker button as well, which on click repleaces the cursor with a color picker.
- III.   Solid Color Picker. Allows the user to select a color.


# C & D-> Tabs and SubOptions
## Tabs can be used to switch between the sub options of the texture types

the Tab component in case of "Texture Type = Image" has three states (Adjust, Transform and Overlay). Each of these Tab options are rendering different sub options, like Hue, Contrast etc.
